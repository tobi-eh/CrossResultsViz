  <h3>Thanks for stopping by!</h3>

  <div>
    This is a little project that was motivated by a few questions I was thinking about while "waiting" to get lapped during some recent races: 
    <ul>
      <li>How many riders do I pass or switch positions with over the course of a race?</li>
      <li>How much slower am I than those riders that are about to lap me?</li>
      <li>How far along the course am I when the podium finishers cross the finish line?</li>
      <li>How much would better starts (faster first laps) help me in getting better results?</li>
      <li>Will gaps between groups of riders increase/decrease over the course of a race?</li>
      <li>Can I visualize a race's trajectory from lap times alone? What would that look like? </li>
    </ul>

    Usually I find the answers to all of life's hard questions on <a href='https://www.crossresults.com/' target="_blank">CrossResults.com</a>, but unfortunately it wasn't able to help me with these. <br/>
  This application was a quick attempt to fix this. I realize there are some issues with this overall approach (e.g. starting positions are whacky (based on CrossResults' <i>Carried Points</i>), a lot happens <i>during</i> a lap that is not captured here, etc) and there are probably some bugs, but I hope you enjoy this tool anyway! Have fun exploring!
